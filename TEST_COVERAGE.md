- hitTest returns results
- hitTest returns empty list on null result
- addAnchor returns anchor
- addAnchor returns null on null result
- removeAnchor sends correct anchorId
- pause calls platform method
- resume calls platform method
- reset calls platform method
- planesStream emits planes from platform
- anchorsStream emits anchors from platform
- errorStream emits errors from platform
- throws StateError when used after dispose
- handles PlatformException gracefully
- dispose can be called multiple times safely
- addModelFromAsset creates model node with correct parameters
- addModelFromUrl creates correct model node

### Integration Tests

#### AR Integration Tests (`example/integration_test/plugin_integration_test.dart`)
Comprehensive integration tests covering the full AR workflow:

**Integration Test Scenarios** (11 tests)
1. AugenView can be created and disposed
2. AugenController can check AR support
3. AugenController can initialize AR session
4. AugenController can add and remove nodes
5. AugenController can perform hit test
6. AugenController can add and remove anchors
7. AugenController can pause and resume
8. AugenController can reset session
9. AugenController streams work correctly
10. Full AR workflow: initialize, add nodes, hit test, clean up
11. Multiple AugenViews can be created sequentially

**Note**: Integration tests require running on a physical device or simulator with AR support:
```bash
# For Android
cd example
flutter test integration_test/plugin_integration_test.dart

# For iOS
cd example
flutter test integration_test/plugin_integration_test.dart
```

## Running Tests

### Run all unit tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
flutter test test/augen_test.dart
flutter test test/augen_controller_test.dart
flutter test test/augen_method_channel_test.dart
```

### Run integration tests
Integration tests require a device or simulator:

**Android:**
```bash
cd example
flutter test integration_test/plugin_integration_test.dart --device-id=<device_id>
```

**iOS:**
```bash
cd example
flutter test integration_test/plugin_integration_test.dart --device-id=<device_id>
```

## Test Quality

The test suite ensures:

1. **Comprehensive Model Coverage**: All data models have full test coverage including:
   - Constructor parameter validation
   - Serialization/deserialization (toMap/fromMap)
   - Equality and hash code
   - String representation
   - Edge cases and null handling

2. **Controller Testing**: AugenController is thoroughly tested with:
   - All method calls properly mocked
   - Stream functionality validated
   - Error handling verified
   - State management tested
   - Lifecycle methods covered

3. **Integration Testing**: Real-world AR workflows are tested including:
   - View creation and disposal
   - AR session initialization
   - Node management (add/update/remove)
   - Hit testing
   - Anchor management
   - Session control (pause/resume/reset)
   - Stream updates
   - Multiple view scenarios

4. **Platform Testing**: Method channel communication is tested to ensure proper Flutter-to-native communication.

## Continuous Integration

All tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:
- Unit tests run without any dependencies
- Integration tests are structured to handle AR unavailability gracefully
- All tests use proper timeouts and error handling
- Mock implementations allow testing without physical devices for unit tests

## Test Maintenance

When adding new features:
1. Add corresponding unit tests for new models/methods
2. Update integration tests for new AR functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass before merging
4. Update this coverage document

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for additional testing:
- Performance benchmarking tests
- Memory leak detection tests
- Platform-specific behavior tests
- Stress testing with many nodes
- Network-related AR features (if added)
